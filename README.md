TicTacToe - CS50 Final Project

Welcome to TicTacToe, a classic game reimagined with a twist of AI! This project, written in Java, is my final project for the CS50 course. It allows you to play TicTacToe against an AI with two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard. Challenge yourself to see if you can outsmart the AI or just enjoy a casual game with a friend.
Features
ðŸŽ® Game Modes

    Single Player Mode: Play against the AI with two difficulty levels:
        Easy Mode: The AI plays randomly 50% of the time, giving you a chance to outwit it.
        Hard Mode: The AI uses the MINIMAX algorithm to play a perfect game. Good luck beating it!
    Two Player Mode: Play against a friend in a classic TicTacToe match.

ðŸ§  AI Implementation

    MINIMAX Algorithm: The AI for Hard Mode is powered by the MINIMAX algorithm, ensuring that it always makes the optimal move. This means that in Hard Mode, the AI is unbeatable if you make no mistakes.
    Randomization in Easy Mode: In Easy Mode, the AI's moves are partially randomized, providing a more relaxed and unpredictable gameplay experience.

How to Play

    Launch the Game: Run the program from your IDE or terminal.
    Choose Game Mode: Select between playing against the AI (Easy or Hard) or against a friend.
    Make Your Move: Click on the grid to place your X or O. The AI or your friend will respond with their move.
    Win the Game: Get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win!
